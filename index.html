					<h2>What is Mochi?</h2>

					<p>Mochi is a Japanese sweet, soft and chewy dessert. It's shaped into a small, round rice cake made of a particular type of sticky rice called mochigome. 
						Mochigome is a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes mochi includes other ingredients such as milk, sugar and cornstarch. Mochigome is a 
						sweeter type of rice compared to the regular steamed rice. </p>

					<h2>Origin</h2>
					<p>The mochi-making method originates in China, where glutinous rice has been cultivated and used for thousands of years. This system was used by a number 
						of Indigenous Chinese tribes as part of their traditions. In legend, the first mochitsuki ceremony took place after the Kami were said to have fallen 
						to Earth, following the birth of rice cultivation in Yamato during the Yayoi period. In the mochi's production, red rice was the original variation.
						It was eaten exclusively by the emperor and nobles at this time because of its status of good fortune. During the Japanese Heian era, mochi 
						was used as a <em>"food for the gods"</em> and as a religious offering in Shinto rituals conducted by nobles. Besides the good fortune, Mochi was also known 
						as a talisman for happy weddings.</p>

					<p>The first documented mochi reports for use as part of New Year's festivities are all from the Japanese Heian Period. The nobles of the royal court 
						claimed that long stretches of freshly made mochi symbolised long life and well-being, whereas dried mochi assisted to strengthen an individual's 
						teeth. The details of this can be located in the earliest Japanese book, The Genji Story.</p>

					<p>Mochi is still a local delicacy enjoyed all across the Japanese New Year because during this time it is available and eaten abundantly. Kagami mochi, 
						is placed every year on the family shrines on <em>December 28</em>. The Kagami mochi consists of two mochi, each with an orange, placed above of each other. 
						The circular kagami mochi rice cakes on just this day, which the samurai traditionally performed, would have been destroyed, thus reflecting the 
						emergence of a reflection and the conclusion of the New Year festivities. </p>
